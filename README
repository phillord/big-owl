This repository provides a set of large OWL files that are useful for
testing software. The files themselves are not distributed as they are
too large! Rather this is a set of makefiles that download or generate
them.

To run you will need robot (http://robot.obolibrary.org/) and
horned-owl (https://github.com/phillord/horned-owl) installed. Robot
is in Java and requires quite a bit of memory to use.

Horned is written in Rust and is much more efficient, but is not
feature complete with Robot (in fact, big-owl was created partly to
test horned!). However, Horned is rather more aggressive with it's
resource use. If you don't have enough, it may crash your machine.

The directories contain:

dto:: The Drug Target Ontology isn't particularly large, but has lots
of imports.

go:: The Gene Ontology. Large, and in both normal and "plus" forms

many-classes:: Generated ontology with various numbers of class
declarations and nothing else

ncbitaxon:: Very large and real ontology
